			<p style="a:hover{text-decoration:underline;}">Water is integral to life on Earth.  It constitutes 60% of an adult human being's mass, and an even larger percent of plants. While 70% of the Earth's surface is covered by water, only a small fraction of that is fresh water, suitable for use by humans for nourishment, agriculture, industry, and recreation.  Because this usable, freshwater is limited, natural resource agencies and research institutions put a lot of effort into better understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of water supply and water quality. While historic patterns are well understood, the future is fraught with uncertainty.  Human induced climate change will alter temperature and precipitation patterns, and the world-wide pattern of migration from rural to urban centers will have important implications for water resources.</p>
			<p>When I began grad school in 2011, my adviser, <a href="http://www.web.pdx.edu/~changh/" target='_blank'>Heejun Chang</a>, hired me on to help with his <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/" target='_blank'>NSF</a> funded research.  The <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/ecosystem-services/" target='_blank'>SESAME Project's</a> goal has been to "test landscape-scale computational models with field data" so that we can better identify areas which are critical to the health of our freshwater resources.  The fruits of this project have so far consisted of two successfully defended theses, and two publications.  My thesis consisted of using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (<a href="http://swat.tamu.edu/" target='_blank'>SWAT</a>) to project changes in future water supply (aka water yield) and water quality as well as the effectiveness of vegetated filter strips in filtering water before it flows into streams. I did this by constructing two SWAT models of the Tualatin and Yamhill basins, which you can see in the map below. The Tualatin is located west of the Portland Metro area and is the more managed basin. The Yamhill is a less populated, more agriculturally dominated basin to the south. Some important locations of flow modifications due to waste water treatment facilities, dams, and inter-basin transfers can also be seen in the map below. </p>

			</script>
			<p>The results of my research confirm that vegetated filter strips are indeed effective at reducing the amount of sediment and nutrients in water. In all cases we saw at least a 40% reduction. We also found that there is large uncertainty in the response of sediment and nutrient levels to climate and urbanization.  This uncertainty is due to both our ability to project future precipitation patters, and also the difficulty of calibrating a SWAT model in a mixed use basin such as the Tualatin. Finally, my research suggests that the SWAT model has the capacity to identify areas of high polutant loads at a medium spatial scale, but since validation studies for this type of SWAT output have not yet been conducted, it is premature to use this methodology to guide management activities.  </p>
