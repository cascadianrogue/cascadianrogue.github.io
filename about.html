			<p>While I've used R and Python quite extensively throughout grad school, I'm realizing that a large portion of mapping is done on the web. With that in mind, I decided to build my own website so I could play around with html, css, and web-mapping tools, api's and software such as <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a>, <a href="http://geojson.io/">geojson</a> and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">mapbox</a>.  As I learn more, I will post my projects here.</p>
			<p>This site is hosted by <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.  As a learning exercise I took the html and css from <a href="http://lyzidiamond.com/">Lyzi Diamond's</a> site, which is hosted by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and I altered it to suit my needs.</p>
			<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
